# hljni - call Java from Haxe/HashLink

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hljni.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hljni)

This [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) + [HashLink](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink) library provides bindings for the [Java Native Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/), allowing for interoperation between Java VM and HashLink run-time. In other words: we can call Java functions from Haxe, which is useful when e.g. running on Android!
