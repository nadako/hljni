Use [Java Native Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/jniTOC.html) from [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) running
in an embedded [HashLink](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink) run-time.

So we can interop with Android APIs from a hashlink game/app built with Android NDK.

Status: TOTALLY EXPERIMENTAL.
